<p style="font-size:6px;">My name is Khalid Shekh and i am a second year unieversity student and i hope for the future that i hoping to break into the tecnology field some of my hobbies include reading books more so into fiction due to the fact that i like the idea of exploring and diving into a fictional world /setting which is why ever since i was a child i was just really into fiction some of these books often include harry potter beast quest lord of the rings.This also ties in to my second hobby that would be game devolopment though i have limited skills at this moment in time at devlolping games as a way to express that creatvity of mine that i devolped over time from getting into multiple fictonal stories and creating my own stories which is why i plan on expressing that creatvity into the tec industry and really make an impact
